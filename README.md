# CBP Music Tracks Plugin (CBP-MT-Plugin)
A simple GUI plugin for [CBP Launcher](https://github.com/MHLoppy/CBP-Launcher) that offers limited customisation of the music tracklists used by RoN:EE.

The plugin was originally created to resolve a bug with the popular Rise of Babel taunt pack, since that pack reverts all tracklists to the original 2003 versions, completely ignoring newer tracks from T&P.

As of CBP Alpha 7c, this plugin is bundled with CBP.
